                <hr>
                <p> You should call 999 when someone is seriously ill or injured and you think their life is at risk! For example, shortness of breath, persistent chest pains, stroke symptoms, serious bleeding or loss of consciousness. </p>

                <hr>
                <p> When you call 999, an operator will ask you which emergency service you need. In a medical emergency, ask for the ambulance service. You will then be put through to one of our call-takers. They will ask you some questions about the patient and your location. This is so we can start arranging help straight away. </p>
