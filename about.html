            <p>
                You should call 999 when someone is seriously ill or injured and you think their life is at risk! For example, shortness of breath, persistent chest pains, stroke symptoms, serious bleeding or loss of consciousness.

            <h2>What happens when you call 999?</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                When you call 999, an operator will ask you which emergency service you need. In a medical emergency, ask for the ambulance service.
                You will then be put through to one of our call-takers. They will ask you some questions about the patient and your location. This is so we can start arranging help straight away.

                For those with drive and ambition we offer many diverse clinically focused career opportunities to deliver care to the communities we serve. These include working as a community paramedic in primary care, as an emergency care practitioner working in both the emergency and GP out of hours settings, or becoming a dispatcher in our modern control centres.
