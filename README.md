# Newport Ambulance Station ðŸš‘
                                                                



# Introduction

This website gives an insight into the core values and purpose of an Ambulance service. You will see real images of The Irish National ambulance service fleet from ambulances, rapid response vehicles to motorbikes and helicopters. You will learn how the process works from when you dial 999 until the Emergency services arrive at your door. With a description of working on the front line and how the roles have evolved over the past decade you will be given the opportunity to sign up to apply for a position in the Ambulance Service. You will be introduced to three real life Paramedics and their different roles and journeys.

Here you will find a live link to my website: https://hughes84.github.io/ambust/

# Visual Studio Code

VS Code my main platform used to code while utilizing the terminal to commit and Push to GitHub.


# Design

The user is first met by the menu screen. Here they can see the name of the site in big bold colours with the menu clearly visible to the left. Below these is an image of several different fleet of the Emergency services that I feel will draw the user in with the colours, detail and variety. I aimed to catch the users attention in with the bright illuminous colours of the vehicles and the glow of the flashing lights. I added a neutral background colour which I felt complimented these colours.

# Further testing

I've tested that this page works in different browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge and Safari.
I've tested that this website is responsive, and looks good on all standard screen sizes the smallest at 320px all the way up to 1400px.
I've confirmed that my webiste has good visibility contrast and it's easy readable for the user, with good contrast colours and displaying good accessibility performance.
I've tested that all internal links are working properly and navigate me through the pages, and clicking on logo takes me back to the home page.
Internal links: Home, About, Staff, Sign Up as well as sign up button sign up page.
I've tested that all external links are taking me to new tab and to related pages that where either in discription or in text.
External links: Facebook, Twitter, Youtube and Instagram.
Where email is required only an email will be accepted in the email field. When all fields are filled correctly you are then sent to thank you page.


# Lighthouse testing

I used Lighthouse testing to audit for performance and accessibility.

# Colours

The colours chosen for this project are those similar to the national ambulance service colours. I used 'green' with it's hex value of '#0e540e', which was used for headings, hover effects and borders. I also used another light green/yellow color to symbolize the luminous bright colour of the Irish ambulances with an rgba(177, 219, 39, 0.7) this also gave the appearance of a see through effect. Around the image of myself I used a brighter 'chartreuse' colour to brighten up the page a bit more with a hex value of '#7fff00'. I used a red hex value '#f44336' for my cancel button on sign up form to highlight the cancel.


# Typography

The Inconsolata font is the title font I used with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font wouldn't import into the site correctly. I used Poppins in my paragraphs as it complimented well with the Inconsolata I felt.


# Imagery

The large, background image stretches through the landing page and is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention at the very first glance and to give the user the idea behind the website. I sourced this image of the fleet of the Irish ambulance service online and downloaded it. The second image is a picture I took of myself at work in the National Ambulance Service. I used some pictures of my work collegaues for the staff section from Facebook with their consent.


# Bugs

As I was buliding my website I was constantly debuging and changing my code
I had some preformance issues in the begining but I managed to rectify it by increasing and decreasing the size of my images and testing different style, ie. float to flex. I tested my page regularly through inspect as well as on various different websites for responsive testing.

 
# Features

**Navigation:**

My navigation is placed on the top right of the page . It displays clicklable tabs which will bring us on directly onto the pages clicked, Home, About, Staff, Sign up.
On the Home page there is a large image of various fleet and personnel with bright colors linked with the ambulance service. I also have the name of the website at the top as well as a short description of the service embedded on the image.


On the About page I have a centred picture of myself at work in uniform with an ambulance in the background. I have this centred with a bright border again showing the bright ambulance colors. At the top I have a heading for the section on whar we do as a service, explained in more detail in four paragraphs, two on the left, two on the right, all titled. Again in the centre closer to the bottom I have the Pre Hospital Emergency Care Council logo. This is the body where Paramedics in Ireland get their licences from.


On the Staff page at the top it describes what you will see in Meet our staff. I then introduce three of my colleagues seperately giving a brief description of their journey and role in the service. Each is then followed by a picture on duty.


On the sign up page I kept with the same theme and colors. I did use a red for the cancel button to highlight it. Here you are encouraged to sign up if you would like to create an account and join the service. A correctly formatted email address is required. If all lines are completed correctly you will be directed to a thank you page thanking you for your application.
