Colours

The colours chosen for this project are those similar to the national ambulance service colours. I used 'green' with it's hex value of '#0e540e', which was used for headings, hover effects and borders. I also used another light green/yellow color to symbolize the luminous bright colour of the Irish ambulances with an rgba(177, 219, 39, 0.7) this also gave the appearance of a see through effect. Around the image of myself I used a brighter 'chartreuse' colour to brighten up the page a bit more with a hex value of '#7fff00'.

Typography

The Inconsolata font is the title font I used with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font wouldn't import into the site correctly. I used Poppins in my paragraphs as it complimented well with the Inconsolata I felt.

Imagery

The large, background image stretches through the landing page and is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention at the very first glance and to give the user the idea behind the website. I sourced this image of the fleet of the Irish ambulance service online and downloaded it. The second image is a picture I took of myself at work in the National Ambulance Service.
