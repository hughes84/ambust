Colours

The colours chosen for this project are those similar to the national ambulance service colours. I used 'green' with it's hex value of '#0e540e', which was used for headings, hover effects and borders. I also used another light green/yellow color to symbolize the luminous bright colour of the Irish ambulances with an rgba(177, 219, 39, 0.7) this also gave the appearance of a see through effect. Around the image of myself I used a brighter 'chartreuse' colour to brighten up the page a bit more with a hex value of '#7fff00'.

Typography

The Inconsolata font is the title font I used with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font wouldn't import into the site correctly. I used Poppins in my paragraphs as it complimented well with the Inconsolata I felt.

Imagery

The large, background image stretches through the landing page and is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention at the very first glance and to give the user the idea behind the website. I sourced this image of the fleet of the Irish ambulance service online and downloaded it. The second image is a picture I took of myself at work in the National Ambulance Service.

Bugs

As I was buliding my website I was constantly debuging and changing my code
I had some preformance issues in the begining but I managed to rectify it by increasing and decreasing the size of my images and testing different style, ie. float to flex. I tested my page regularly through inspect as well as on various different websites for responsive testing.
 

Features

Navigation

My navigation is placed on the top right of the page . It displays clicklable tabs which will bring us on directly onto the pages clicked, Home, About, Staff, Sign up.
On the Home page there is a large image of various fleet and personnel with bright colors linked with the ambulance service. I also have the name of the website at the top as well as a short description of the service embedded on the image.
On the About page I have a centred picture of myself at work in uniform with an ambulance in the background. I have this centred with a bright border again showing the bright ambulance colors.
