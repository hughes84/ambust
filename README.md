# Introduction 

This website gives an insight into the core values and purpose of an Ambulance service. You will see real images of The Irish National ambulance service fleet from ambulances, rapid response vehicles to motorbikes and helicopters. You will learn how the process works from when you dial 999 until the Emergency services arrive at your door. With a description of working on the front line and how the roles have evolved over the past decade you will be given the opportunity to sign up to apply for a position in the Ambulance Service. You will be introduced to three real life Paramedics and their different roles and journeys.

Here you will find a live link to my website: https://hughes84.github.io/ambust/

# Design



**Wireframe**

I invisaged my first website to be basic, prompt and staright to the point. I wanted some images to jump out to grab the users attention immediately.

# Features

**Navigation:**

My navigation bar is placed on the top of the page underneath the logo. It displays clicklable tabs which will bring us on directly onto the pages clicked, Home, About, Staff, Sign up. When scrolling it will stay fixed as to allow the user to go to any section they want with ease.

# Existing Features


The user is first met by the menu screen. Here they can see the name of the site in big bold colours with the menu clearly visible above. Below these, is an image of several different fleet from the Emergency services that I feel will draw the user in with the colours, detail and variety. I aimed to catch the users attention with the bright illuminous colours of the vehicles and the glow of the flashing lights. I added a neutral background colour which I felt complimented these colours well.

Next the user is met with the heading of the second section. With just a few simple words the user knows what this section is about straight away. There is a logo below this of when to call 999. I give a brief synopsis on the left of the page of same, and another to the right of the page on getting involved, giving the user food for thought on whether this could be a role for them.


![image](assets/images/About1.png)

Further down in the same section I have a centre logo of the Pre Hospital Emergency Care Council, the governing body who issues Paramedic licences in Ireland. To the left of the page I give a description of the process of what happens when you dial 999 to the time the emergency services arrive at your door. On the right of the page I explain the different roles there is in the service, showing that there is a variety of careers to explore on and off the road. I believe these short but detailed paragraphs give enough information to captivate the users attention.

Scrolling down, I introduce the user to three of my colleagues from the service. Two paramedics that work on an ambulance and an advanced paramedic who works on a helicopter with the Irish Coastguard. I give the user a look into each medics background, skills and goals for the future with a picture of each in a different setting again making it real and giving variety, keeping the users attention.

At the end of the site the user is met with the sign up page. Here the user is given the option to make an account, signing up to join the service. The user must enter a valid email address to submit the form. On completion of entering a valid email address and password the user will click the sign up button below. They will then be directed to a new page, where the following message will appear; Thank You, Your Form Has Been Submitted!Thank you for your application, we will be in contact in due course.
If the user wishes to clear their entry and start over, this can be done using the clear button.
On the bottom of the page there are five live links to Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, Instagram and Copyright.

# Further testing

- I've tested that this page works in different browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge and Safari.
- I've tested that this website is responsive, and looks good on all standard screen sizes the smallest at 320px   all the way up to 1400px.
- I've confirmed that my webiste has good visibility contrast and it's easy readable for the user, with good contrast colours and displaying good accessibility performance.
- I've tested that all internal links are working properly and navigate me through the pages, and clicking the fixed navigation bar brings me back to the relevant section.
- Internal links: Home, About, Staff, Sign Up as well as sign up button and clear button on sign up page.
- I've tested that all external links are taking me to new tab and to related pages that where either in description or in text.
- External links: Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, Instagram and Copyright.
- Where email is required only an email will be accepted in the email field. When all fields are filled correctly you are then sent to thank you page.

# Colours

The colours chosen for this project are those similar to the national ambulance service colours. I used 'green' with it's hex value of '#0e540e', which was used for headings, hover effects and borders, with a background colour of rgba(241, 241, 79, 0.7), on the heading and navigation on the main page. I also used another light green/yellow color to symbolize the luminous bright colour of the Irish ambulances with an rgba(177, 219, 39, 0.7) this also gave the appearance of a see through effect. Around the image of myself I used a brighter 'chartreuse' colour to brighten up the page a bit more with a hex value of '#7fff00'. The input sections on sign up form I used a lighter green of '#d8f2be', and when details are input this changes to a white '#ddd', for clearer viewing. I used a red hex value '#f44336' for my cancel button on sign up form to highlight the cancel. I used a neutral colour of '#FFF2CC' as a background throughout the site which I feel compliments it well.  


# Typography

The Inconsolata font is the title font I used with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font wouldn't import into the site correctly. I used Poppins in my paragraphs as it complimented well with the Inconsolata I felt.


# Imagery

The large, background image stretches through the landing page and is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention at the very first glance and to give the user the idea behind the website. I sourced this image of the fleet of the Irish ambulance service online and downloaded it. I used some pictures of my work collegaues for the staff section from Facebook with their consent.

# Bugs

As I was buliding my website I was constantly debuging and changing my code.
I had some preformance issues in the begining but I managed to rectify it by increasing and decreasing the size of my images and testing different style, ie. float to flex. I tested my page regularly through inspect as well as on various different websites for responsive testing.
